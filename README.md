# Quest-215
The game I created for CSE-215-100. It's not great, but for what it is it works pretty well.

Note, some of the png files here are not used in the game, but are in the program, in the _215_sprites file.
If you want, you can download only what you need by looking through the code and downloading only the files you see,
or you can just download them all. I don't really care. This is just a display of the project history and various experiments.

The actual game is run from the file "new_test.py".
